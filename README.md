# Numerical-Methods
The resources that i've scattered around the semester for Numerical Analysis, it contains python-matlab source code and obsidian-markdown notes of classes.

## Installing dependencies

If you are in windows, first make sure to have python3 and pip installed, any recent version should do the work.

Then, open a terminal and run the following commands:

`pip install sympy numpy matplotlib`

Which are some basic dependencies needed to run the python files in your local machine.
