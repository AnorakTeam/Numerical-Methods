# Numerical-Methods
The resources that i've scattered around the semester for Numerical Analysis, it contains python-matlab source code and obsidian-markdown notes of classes.

## How do i use the resources in this repository?
Check the notes inside the notes folder, and if you want to check the algorithms take a look at the source code.

## Installing dependencies

If you are in windows, first make sure to have python3 and pip installed, any recent version should do the work.

Then, open a terminal and run the following commands:

`pip install sympy numpy matplotlib`

Which are some basic dependencies needed to run the python files in your local machine.

## Matlab && GNU Octave

These are the two programs used for the ".m" source files. I personally prefer GNU Octave, but any software that can process these files should work.
